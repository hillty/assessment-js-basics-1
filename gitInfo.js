let gitHubDefinition = "Git hub is a web-based platform for software developers where they can share their own code, and/or share code back and forth for projects that multiple developers are working on. It can also be used as a resume to display your code changes quickly and easily."

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE

let gitAddDefinition = "git add will add the files that are being worked on to be tracked."

let gitAddCode = "git add"
// QUESTION: not sure if this is allowed, but i have had some instances where i use 'git add' and that is all i need and others it makes me use 'git add .' is there a reason for that? Thanks! 

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.
