// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process of determining what you will want/need to include in the project depending on the cusotmers and/or your needs."
const design = "This is where the software architects and developers make decisions like the tech stack to be used, the language, frameworks, and libraries to be used."
const implementation = "This phase is when developers start coding according to the requirements and design from before. Once the code has been completed for the project it becomse the input for the next phase of the lifecycle."
const testingAndIntegration = "This phase has the goal of integrating everything that was done to this point into the finished product to accomplish the goals set in the planning/requirements phases. The entire system should be ready for integration testing at this point."
const maintain = "This phase is for doing just what it is named, mainting. That could be improving the code, fixing bugs, etc. This is the last phase, and the product or project has been released. This is also when we rinse and repeat if necessary should the customer wish to add mor functionality."
